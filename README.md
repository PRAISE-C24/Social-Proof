# What I learned
I learned how to make the web resposive.

And I also learned how to add some cool layer to a page using the Css flex-box.

here are some of my Css code!
```css
@media screen and (min-width:1024px){
     .down-container{
        display:flex;
        width: 80%;
        gap:2.2rem;
        margin-top: 2rem;
    }
    .box{
        padding: 30px 30px;
        border-radius: 7px;
        margin: 1.2rem auto;
    }
    .box2 {
        position: relative;
        top: 15px;
    }
    .box3 {
        position: relative;
        top: 35px;
    }
}
```
